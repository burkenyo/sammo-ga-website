## About sammo.ga

This site represents a labor of love (or necessity?) as I endeavored to learn front-end web technologies and build a web site from scratch. It’s also a new place to showcase my [Mathematical Melodies project](/melodies). Back when I was studying composition full time, I wrote that page as a way to explore using mathematical constants intrinsic to the universe and their never-ending decimal expansions as input to generate musical melodies. It was a single giant HTML file with embedded scripts powered by JQuery. Let’s hope its new home is a marked improvement!
